Once upon a time there lived a monkey on a bank of a river in the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife.
The Monkey often offered fruits to the crocodile and they became friends and met everyday.The monkey offered fruits to the crocodile's wife and
she got jelous.if the fruits are so juicy i wonder how sweet the monkey heart would be told the crocodile's wife.
The crocodile was not willing to kill his friend but he had no choice.The crocodile killed the monkey and offered it to his wife.
